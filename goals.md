  ## Evolution of Cultural Complexity
  September 21, 2017 (8:30-17:00)
  Cancun, Mexico 

---

In this satellite meeting we want to bring together a community of
researchers coming from different scientific domains and interested in
different aspect of the evolution of social and cultural complexity.
From archaeologists, to linguists, social scientists, historians and
artificial intelligence specialists - the topic of sociocultural
complexity transgresses traditional discipline boundaries. We want to
establish and promote a constructive dialogue incorporating different
perspectives: theoretical as well as empirical approaches, research
based on historical and archaeological sources, as well as actual
evidences and contemporary theories. We are particularly interested in
formal approaches which enable more constructive theory building and
hypothesis testing. However, even establishing common vocabulary of
terms and concepts and discussing the main methodological challenges in
studying sociocultural complexity is an important step towards a more
cohesive framework for the understanding of cultural evolution in
general and for individual research case studies in particular. Our
approach is informed by the convergence between simulation and formal
methods in archaeological studies and recent developments in complex
systems science and complex network analysis.

The session will focus but is not limited to:
-   Social dynamics of innovation.
-   Cumulative Culture and social learning.
-   Evolution of Technology and technological changes
-   Cognitive Process,Creativity, cooperation and innovation
-   Population Dynamics and Demographic Studies
-   Computer tools to understand the cultural evolutionary change
