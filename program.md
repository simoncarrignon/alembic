### Program

Hello world

<!---
Knowing the controversial nature of the topic and the lack of consensus on thoses questions, we think (and know by experience?) that the best format to successfully push forward the discussion is a one day satellite with time for discussion.  

We propose a day with 8 presentation, 4 on the morning and 4 on the evening. Half of the talk will be 45min presentation+question made by the Invited Speakers, the other half will be 30min presentation+question on the submitted abstract.

We propose to end the day be a 1:30 panel discussion.
