Human sociocultural evolution has been documented throughout the history
of humans and earlier hominins. This evolution manifests itself through
development from tools as simple as a rock used to break nuts, to as
complex as a spaceship able to land man on other planets. Equally, we
have witnessed evolution of human population towards complex multilevel
social organisation.

Although cases of decrease and loss of this type of complexity* *have
been reported, in global terms it tends to increase with time. Despite
its significance, the conditions and the factors driving this increase
are still poorly understood and subject to debate. Different hypothesis
trying to explain the rise of sociocultural complexity in human
societies have been proposed (demographic factor, cognitive component,
historical contingency...) but so far no consensus has been reached.

Here we raisea number of questions:

1.  Can we better define sociocultural complexity and confirm its
    general tendency to increase over the course of human history?
2.  What are the main factors enablingan increase of cultural
    complexity?
3.  Are there reliable way to measure the complexity in material culture
    and social organisationconstructs, that is?
4.  How can we quantify and compare the impact of different factors?
5.  What causes a loss of cultural complexity in a society? And how
    often these losses occurred in the past?
6.  ...
